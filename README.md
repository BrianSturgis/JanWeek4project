## Application Description

This is a weekly project for the January Cohort at Epicodus.
This is a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

## The projects objectives were to complete the following (MVP)
- Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
- Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
- Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.
- Style the application with CSS and images.
- Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.
- Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.

## Known Bugs
- button placement needs work and some of them are too big
- css layout is a wireframe at this point.
